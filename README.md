Pathogen list for brain infections
A total of 1488 bacterial pathogens were manually classified based on their association with brain infections. 
Class I = known CNS pathogen (60/1488)
Class II = reported to be a CNS pathogen without iatrogenic introduction but usually opportunistic with the right host (221/1488)
Class III= unlikely CNS pathogen unless introduced iatrogenically or hospital-acquired infection in a neonate - also if only 1-2 cases reported (466/1488)
Class IV= not a likely pathogen in the CNS at all (741/1488)
