# BI_metagenomics
Pathogen list to support metagenomics for diagnosis of brain infections.
A total of 1488 bacterial pathogens were manually classified based on their association with infections of the central nervous system (CNS).
Class I = known CNS pathogen (60/1488)
Class II = reported to be a CNS pathogen without iatrogenic introduction, but is usually opportunistic, requiring a susceptible host (221/1488)
Class III = unlikely CNS pathogen, unless introduced iatrogenically or in a neonate; also included if only 1-2 cases have been reported in the literature (466/1488)
Class IV = not a likely pathogen in the CNS at all (741/1488)
